The GUI works like the other GUI Panels (draggable, close-able, resize-able), but there is a new button that is Fullscreen. Fullscreen will put the GUI to fit the whole page. 

Current Version: 1.0 

### File & folder Storing 
This extension allows coders to upload files an folders in the project. Once created a new folder or uploaded a folder, you can create or upload many files in the folder. You can run the file in a new tab, new window, or a redirect as a blob url, data url, about:blank, or normal. 

WARNING: the block `[Open file: (file.html) from folder: (folder1) mode: [Blob, data, about:blank, normal] in [new tab, new window, redirect]]` with Mode `normal` will break the editor so (During Testing), use in a tested packaged project or save before use because the mode `Normal` Sets the page to the html code ran. 

Current Version: 1.0
